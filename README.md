## Hi, I'm Marek 👋

I am a coding enthusiast 🖥️, specializing mainly in C# (maybe even too much). Sometimes when I come to my senses, I have fun with Python (who doesn't like AI, right?) and Go.
You can also find me at: [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Phoenix510) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mnowak250).
